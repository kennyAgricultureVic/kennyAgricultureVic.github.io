### (Optional) Loading multiple samples 
!!! note

    The following search has only been tested up to 1000 samples. The interface will become extremely slow if even larger samples are selected. If it does become slow, just refresh the page and you can restart.
To select a range of samples, hold down the CRTL key and select another sample in the list.
