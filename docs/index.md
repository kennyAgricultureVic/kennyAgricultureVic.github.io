Pretzel is an interactive web application designed to enable rapid translation of genomics outputs for any species into concrete answers to research and breeding questions

Learn about how Pretzel can connect legacy QTL results and pan genomes to the AGG with [User Story 3 - From SSRs to pan genomes with Pretzel: Two decades of wheat yield QTLs on chromosome 7A](https://docs.plantinformatics.io/User-Stories/User-story-3/).

## Funding
Pretzel is currently (2022-) funded as part of the Australian Grains Genebank Strategic Partnership, a $30M joint investment between the Victorian State Government and Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC) that aims to unlock the genetic potential of plant genetic resources for the benefit of the Australian grain growers.
