# User Story 3 - Exploring the wheat pan genome in Pretzel

There are three main parts to this User Story:

1. In the first part, we will learn how to navigate the wheat pan genome in Pretzel, and visualise some well known results such as the 5B/7B translocation and the *Thinopyrum ponticum* introgression in Longreach Lancer at the end of 3DL.

2. In the second part, we will briefly summarise results from the last 20 years around yield on chromosome 7A. We will use Pretzel to integrate a range of QTL studies and ultimately identify the APO1 gene.

3. Finally, we will combine the first two parts to:

   - Reproduce results reported in *Kuzay et al. 2019* and *Voss-Fels et al. 2019* relating to haplotypes carried by the 10+ Wheat Genomes in the APO region of chromosome 7A
   - Extend these results to classify wheat PGR accessions in the AGG
   - Identify wheat PGR accessions in the AGG carrying rare APO haplotypes

### Assemblies from the 10+ Wheat Genome project in Pretzel

The 10 chromosome-scale assemblies from *Walkowiak et al. 2020* have been curated and made available in AGG Pretzel: ArinaLrFor, CDC Landmark, CDC Stanley, Jagger, Julius, Long Reach Lancer, Mace, Norin 61, SY Mattis and spelt wheat PI 190962.

## Assembly metadata

Metadata about the assemblies can be viewed by clicking on the respective Genome entry in the Pretzel Datasets Explorer. The metadata has been extracted from *Walkowiak et al. 2020* and includes accession name, pedigree, growth habit, origin and EBI-ENA ID.

## Gene annotations by PGSB

De novo gene annotations from *White et al. 2024* (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.09.574802) are available.

## Infinium Wheat Barley 40K v1.1 SNP array marker mappings

Markers from the Infinium Wheat Barley 40K v1.1 SNP array, which is being used to genotype the AGG wheat collection, have been mapped to each of the 10+ Wheat genomes using <a href="https://github.com/plantinformatics/brioche" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brioche</a>.

The mapping of markers across the genomes enables chromosome-scale alignments to be visualised, and regions to be projected from one genome to another (similar to how regions were projected between IWGSC RefSeq v1.0 and IWGSC RefSeq v2.1 in User Story 2).
