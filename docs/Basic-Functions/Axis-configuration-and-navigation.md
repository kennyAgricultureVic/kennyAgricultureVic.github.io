=== "Access via Axis title menu"
    
    1. **Split the Axis**:
     To view multiple data sets simultaneously, such as different marker types or genes aligned against the same genome or chromosome, the split axis feature is very useful. To enable it, click on the axis menu layout, select the downward-slanting arrow, and close the menu by clicking the cross in the top right corner.
    Split axis could be done either before or after adding datasets to the axis.
