# Features tab

The Features tab is located in the right panel. It displays information about features that have been selected in the main view.

## Example: Wheat Barley 40k marker positions in barley

Add the ```Hordeum vulgare - MorexV3 - Markers - Wheat Barley 40k v1.1``` dataset for `chr1H` to the view, open the axis and zoom in until features are displayed in the axis.

Next, select a region of the axis and click the Features tab in the right panel. Information about the selected features is displayed in the table. Clicking the header of a column will sort by that column.

## Example: Viewing Gene Ontology (GO) terms for genes in the IWGSC RefSeq v2.1 wheat annotation

Depending on the dataset, different information may be available for each feature. With gene annotations, often extra information is included about the gene, including alternative IDs, functional annotation or GO terms.

To visualise the Gene Ontology annotation for wheat genes, load the ```Triticum aestivum - IWGSC_RefSeq_v2.1 - Genes HC``` dataset, open the axis and zoom in until features are displayed in the axis.

Next, select a region of the axis and click the Features tab in the right panel. For this annotation, a range of information has been added to the record for each gene.

Re-arrange the panels if needed, to be able to see the contents of the Features table more clearly. The column named *GI-IDs-Description-via-Interpro* includes GO terms for each gene.
