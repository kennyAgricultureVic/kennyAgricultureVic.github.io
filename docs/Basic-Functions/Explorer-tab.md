# Explorer tab

The Explorer tab is the main page. It allows users to quickly see a list of all datasets that are available in Pretzel, search for a specific dataset, and load them into the view for further analysis. A full list of datasets can be viewed by scrolling down in the datasets box. Optionally users and use a combination of filters and search bar to narrow down the list of datasets.

## Search bar

To filter the datasets based on the name, the user can enter the name in the search bar. 

![1 Explorertab_Search](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc31fd68-a27a-4b5c-8f03-6f0adf97b5e5)

The text search comes with two optional parameters:

**Case sensitive/insensitive mode**:
When selected, capitalisation will be taken into account when performing the search.
![Case-sensitive-insensitive](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/218d16a7-9690-41e8-85f8-1a0adc4f39a8)

**Match all/any mode**:
When selected, the search will return the results that match its individual components.
![Match-all-any-mode](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63133a3c-b19a-45f2-a817-349d053dd03c)
By default, the search is conducted under case insensitive and match all parameters.

!!! note

    Datasets with a lock icon on the right side are private and accessible only to authorized users. 

## Filters

Results could be filtered based on either of the following:

| Parameter     | Description                         |
| : ----------- | :---------------------------------- |
| Alignment     | Refers to genes and genetic markers |
| Genome        | Refers to whole genome assemblies   |
| ** All datasets **  | Refers to entire database           |

Currently, sorting the results based on Traits and Ontology is not functioning.

* Filter for Alignments

* Filter for Genome
![Genome-mode](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97cae7e6-3b9a-4ead-a473-66d18ad65645)

* Show all datasets (no filter)

## Viewing dataset details

Clicking on the name of a dataset will highlight it and show information about the data set on the right hand panel

![3 Explorertab_Viewdatasetinfo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a62f451e-1039-4079-b4e8-572bde00fe1c)
Pressing the plus button expands the dataset, revealing items that can be added to the view by clicking their respective green plus buttons. This action loads the selected item into the view.  

![4 Explorertab_Add dataset](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1398934b-9344-4012-8ca9-72d3d3633ed8)

* To view the data set, user needs to open the axis title menu and click on the split axis icon.

 ![5 Explorertab_Add dataset_splitaxis](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f4ab41d-13a5-4640-8cab-6fdf1dd8572d)

* User can add further datasets and view them simultaneously.

 ![Add-more-datasets-revised](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b606e67e-6fa3-49f6-9144-244353c5f8af)
3. If the dataset is no longer needed it can be removed by opening the axis title menu and clicking on the left cross icon in the middle panel.

![Clear-datasets-revised](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f70a6846-e1f7-49bd-b4d8-861a80a07ea4)

For more information on split axis and to view/remove particular datasets, refer to the [Axis title menu layout](../Basic-Functions/Axis-title-menu.md).

## Upload new data
The green plus icon at the top-right corner of the listed datasets allows users to upload new data tailored to their objectives. The uploaded data remains confidential to the user until they choose to make it public.
