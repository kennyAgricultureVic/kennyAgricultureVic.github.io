# Explorer tab

!!! Info

    By default, when the page loads it will always be on the Explorer Tab. This tab allows users to quickly navigate and open all datasets, recently viewed chromosomes, or favorite datasets. It also enables users within a specific group to access and use data categorized under that group, which is typically not public.

## Datasets included in Pretzel

 List of the _Triticum aestivum_, _Hordeum vulgare_ and _Cicer arietinium_ datasets currenty housed in Pretzel could be assessed using the following link:

   ```

## Search and filter the datasets 

1. Scroll down to the datasets box and enter your search term in the text box. The search results will appear in the bottom-most blue-colored section.

2. Searching datasets could be done either under **case sensitive/insensitive** mode and to show results that **Match all/any** (if selected 'any' - search will return the results that match its individual components) dataset using the toggle button. By default, the search is conducted under case insensitive and match all parameters.

!!! note

    Datasets with a lock icon on the right side are private and accessible only to authorized users.

3. Results could be filtered based on either of the following:

| Parameter     | Description                         |
| : ----------- | :---------------------------------- |
| Alignment     | Refers to genes and genetic markers |
| Genome        | Refers to whole genome assemblies   |
| All datasets  | Refers to entire database           |

Currently, sorting the results based on Traits and Ontology is not functioning.

  *  Alignment mode

2. Pressing the plus button expands the dataset, revealing items that can be added to the view by clicking their respective green plus buttons. This action loads the selected item into the view.

* To view the data set, user needs to open the axis title menu and click on the split axis icon.

 ![5 Explorertab_Add dataset_splitaxis](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f4ab41d-13a5-4640-8cab-6fdf1dd8572d)

* User can add further datasets and view them simultaneously.

3. If the dataset is no longer needed it can be removed by opening the axis title menu and clicking on the left cross icon in the middle panel.

For more information on split axis and to view/remove particular datasets, refer to the **Axis title menu layout**.

## Upload new data
The green plus icon at the top-right corner of the listed datasets allows users to upload new data tailored to their objectives. The uploaded data remains confidential to the user until they choose to make it public.
